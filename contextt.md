Plan and Resources for Building the ‚ÄúTouch Uranus First‚Äù Interactive Leaderboard Website
Project Overview
‚ÄúTouch Uranus First‚Äù is a playful web campaign inspired by clicker games like Popcat, but with a space-themed, meme-centric twist. Users will click (or ‚Äútouch‚Äù) a big 3D planet Uranus on screen, contributing to a global counter. A country-based leaderboard will rank which nations ‚Äútouch Uranus‚Äù the most, fostering friendly competition (much like how Popcat‚Äôs country leaderboard drove fierce competition among users globally
thesun.my
). The site should be highly interactive and humorous ‚Äì expect funny sounds, surprise animations (easter eggs), and an overall absurd, cartoonish sci-fi vibe. Below is a detailed plan covering the tech stack, features implementation, asset preparation, and a timeline to build this in ~6 hours, with resources for each aspect.
Technology Stack & Key Tools
Framer (for web design and prototyping): Framer‚Äôs web-based site builder can be used to quickly layout the page and handle responsive design and basic interactions. It also allows embedding custom code or components. This means we can design the UI visually and still insert our custom interactive elements where needed. Framer is known as ‚Äúa platform for interactive design and prototyping‚Äù
framer.com
 ‚Äì perfect for creating our space-themed interface and adding scroll/hover effects. We can leverage Framer‚Äôs ease of design for the static sections (header, footer, info section) and embed dynamic content (like the 3D canvas or animations).
Three.js (for 3D graphics): Three.js is a popular WebGL library for rendering 3D in the browser. We‚Äôll use it to create the interactive Uranus planet model that users can click. With Three.js, we can generate a sphere geometry and apply a Uranus texture or color to represent the planet. This allows cool effects like rotation, zooming, or a 3D ‚Äútouch‚Äù animation. Using Three.js via a React wrapper (e.g. react-three-fiber) is possible if we go with a React/Framer code approach, but given the time constraints a simple Three.js script embedded into the page might be quicker. (If direct Three.js coding proves complex under time pressure, an alternative is using Spline ‚Äì see below).
Spline 3D (optional): Spline is a user-friendly 3D design tool that can export interactive scenes to the web. We can model a cartoonish Uranus in Spline (essentially a sphere with material and maybe rings) and then embed it into Framer via an <iframe> or embed component. According to a Framer tutorial, combining these tools is straightforward: ‚Äúexport the link from Spline and paste it into an Embed component in Framer‚Äù
framer.com
. This approach requires almost no coding ‚Äì Spline handles the 3D, and Framer places it on the site ‚Äì making it a quick way to add interactive 3D
framer.com
. The Spline model can include basic animations or responsiveness to mouse (e.g. rotation on hover). However, capturing click events from Spline might be tricky, so we may overlay an invisible HTML button on top of the 3D object to register touches if needed.
Lottie Animations: Lottie is a JSON-based animation format that plays vector animations on the web smoothly. We‚Äôll use Lottie for various space-themed animations and easter eggs (like a flying rocket, UFO, or the ‚ÄúUranus logo‚Äù appearing). Thousands of free Lottie animations exist, and they‚Äôre easy to embed with the Lottie Web Player. The benefit is that Lotties are lightweight and scalable (vector-based) and can be triggered via JavaScript for interactivity
lottiefiles.com
lottiefiles.com
. For example, we can preload a rocket Lottie and only play it (or set it visible) when a user‚Äôs click count hits a certain milestone. Lottie also supports some basic interactivity out-of-the-box (e.g., hover or click to play) and an Interactivity API for advanced control
lottiefiles.com
.
Rive (alternative to Lottie for interactive assets): Rive is an animation tool that includes a state machine for interactivity. It lets you design vector graphics and define how they respond to inputs (e.g., a click can trigger a new animation state). This could be ideal for the Uranus planet or other UI elements because we could create a single Rive animation that has different states (idle, touched, ‚Äúinside Uranus‚Äù mode, etc.) and toggle them on events. The Rive web runtime is open-source and can be integrated via a simple <canvas> or <rive> component
rive.app
rive.app
. For instance, we could have the planet subtly bobbing in idle state, then on each click we briefly play a ‚Äúsquish‚Äù or ‚Äúbounce‚Äù animation, all defined in Rive. However, using Rive means designing/importing our assets into the Rive editor, which might be too time-consuming if we‚Äôre not already familiar. If we already have PNG assets, we‚Äôd need to convert them to vector shapes to use effectively in Rive.
Audio (for sound effects): Using HTML5 Audio or the Web Audio API to trigger sound effects on each click. This is straightforward: load sound files (MP3/OGG) and play them on tap events. We should prepare a few funny sounds ‚Äì e.g., a ‚Äúpop‚Äù or ‚Äúboop‚Äù sound for each touch, and possibly a rarer ‚ÄúUranus!‚Äù voice clip (for example, every 10th click or on a special milestone, a voice says ‚ÄúUranus!‚Äù in a comical way). Audio files can be triggered in JS; to avoid spam and lag, we might limit rapid-fire playback (Popcat had measures to throttle sound spam). We‚Äôll also include a mute/unmute toggle for user convenience (so mobile users or anyone can silence it if needed).
Backend for Leaderboard: We need a backend service to track the global touch counts per country and serve updates in real-time. The fastest way is to use a Backend-as-a-Service:
Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore: Firebase can store a simple JSON like {countryCode: totalTouches} and update it atomically. The Realtime Database is particularly suited for this because it can ‚Äúsynchronize data in realtime to every connected client‚Äù
firebase.google.com
 with minimal setup. We can use Firebase‚Äôs JavaScript SDK to increment the count for the user‚Äôs country whenever they click, and listen for changes to update the leaderboard UI live. This avoids writing a custom server from scratch and handles concurrent updates reasonably well (we might use transactions or a cloud function to prevent race conditions if needed).
Supabase or Hasura: Alternatively, a quick Postgres database with row per country and a simple REST API could work, but setting up real-time listeners is easier with Firebase. Given the 6-hour timeframe, Firebase is likely the quickest route.
We must also identify the user‚Äôs country on the frontend (so we know which leaderboard entry to increment). This can be done via an IP Geolocation API. For example, country.is is a free API that returns the user‚Äôs country by IP with no auth needed (‚Äúfree IP-to-country geolocation API... no API key needed‚Äù
country.is
). We can fetch https://country.is/ which returns a JSON like {country: "US"}. Another popular one is ip-api.com which returns detailed info without an API key
ip-api.com
. We just need the country code (preferably ISO alpha-2 code to map to flags).
With the country code in hand, each click event will call a function to update that country‚Äôs count in the DB. On Firebase, this could be a .update({ [countryCode]: increment(+1) }) type operation or use Cloud Function to securely increment. For simplicity in a demo, client-side increments are okay, but a production version might secure it to prevent abuse.
The leaderboard display can show the top X countries and their touch counts. We can listen to the database for changes and update the DOM accordingly. This gives the fun real-time competition feel. (It‚Äôs this global competition that made Popcat engaging, as countries raced for top rank
thesun.my
.)
Note: To prevent cheating or bots (like auto-click scripts), we might implement a rate limit per client (e.g., max 10 clicks per second counted) or fingerprint to avoid one user spoofing millions of touches. Popcat, for example, limited clicks and banned obvious scripts. Given our tight timeline, we may implement a basic limit in JS (ignore extremely fast bursts).
Web Sharing & Social APIs: For the social share feature, we will use simple front-end solutions:
Twitter (X): Use an ‚Äúintent to tweet‚Äù URL with a pre-filled message. For example: https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20just%20touched%20Uranus%20üöÄ%20enteruranus.com%20%23Uranus%20%24URANUS. This opens a tweet composer with the text and hashtags filled in (note: %23 is # URL-encoded, %24 is $). We‚Äôll provide a Twitter icon/button that links to this.
TikTok: TikTok doesn‚Äôt have a straightforward web share URL for a text. We might just provide a button that copies a snippet to clipboard for TikTok (so users can paste it in a video description if they make one) or encourage them to create a TikTok with the hashtag. Alternatively, use the general Web Share API: on mobile browsers, navigator.share() can trigger the native share sheet with our URL and text.
Reddit: Provide a link to Reddit‚Äôs submit page with URL and title pre-filled (though for just sharing a fun site, many users will just copy link).
In short, we‚Äôll definitely include Twitter share (since crypto/meme communities are very active on Twitter), and possibly generic share for others. After a user finishes a session of clicks (or even after the first click), a little popup or side panel can prompt: ‚ÄúI just touched Uranus üöÄ! Share it:‚Äù [Twitter icon][TikTok icon][Reddit icon] etc.
Mobile-Friendly Design: Ensure the site is responsive. Framer can help lay out a design that works on desktop and mobile. But we also must handle mobile-specific considerations:
Use large touch targets (the Uranus planet button should be big and centered on small screens).
Avoid hover-only effects; use click/tap events that work on touch.
Test that the 3D canvas or embed is not too heavy for mobile browsers. Perhaps use simpler graphics on mobile or reduce effects (e.g., fewer background stars).
Sound on mobile: mobile browsers typically allow sound only on user interaction, which our click events are. But rapid taps might be constrained (some mobile Safari versions throttle rapid audio play ‚Äì we might need to reuse a single Audio object to play quick successive sounds instead of overlapping).
No fixed width elements that cause horizontal scrolling; use flexible CSS units so the leaderboard and info section wrap nicely on narrow screens.
Possibly hide or simplify the starfield background on mobile if performance lags (or provide a toggle to turn off animations).
Test on both Android Chrome and iOS Safari if possible during the build.
Latest AI Tools for Asset Creation: To expedite content creation, we can leverage AI tools:
Recraft AI: Recraft offers an image vectorizer and Lottie exporter. We can ‚Äúupload an existing PNG/JPEG and convert it into a vector using the Recraft vectorizer, then export as Lottie‚Äù
recraft.ai
. This is useful if, say, we have a static logo or character in PNG and want to get a quick animated version. We might not get a complex animation automatically, but even a simple pulsing or spinning effect applied to the vector could be done.
Midjourney or DALL-E: If we need additional cartoon assets (for example, a funny astronaut or an alien UFO and we don‚Äôt have one in our kit), we can prompt an AI image generator for it. Since it‚Äôs a meme project, consistency in style isn‚Äôt too critical ‚Äì a quick cartoon rocket or a goofy alien could be generated in seconds and then used. We‚Äôd have to remove backgrounds (using an AI background remover or Photoshop) if the image AI doesn‚Äôt produce transparent PNGs.
Kling AI (text-to-video): Kling AI is a model for AI-generated videos
klingai.org
klingai.org
. While likely not needed here (we prefer interactive animations over pre-rendered video), it‚Äôs worth noting in case we wanted a short ‚Äúentering Uranus‚Äù video sequence. However, integration of a video is less interactive, so we will probably skip this due to time.
ChatGPT/Claude (AI coding assistants): As you mentioned, you‚Äôll use Claude (and we could also use GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT Code Interpreter) to help generate code for the site. This can speed up writing boilerplate for Three.js scenes, Firebase calls, and even the PFP generator canvas code. The key is to clearly prompt these AI with what we want (e.g., ‚ÄúWrite a JavaScript function to overlay one image over another and export as PNG‚Äù). Since time is short, using AI to produce code snippets for routine tasks is a smart move ‚Äì just be ready to debug or adjust if the output isn‚Äôt perfect.
Webflow (alternative): Webflow is another web design tool with an intuitive visual editor and the ability to add custom code. If Framer didn‚Äôt suffice, Webflow could have been an option to design the site and then embed custom scripts for the interactive parts (Webflow allows embedding HTML/JS or using its interactions for simpler stuff). However, building something as dynamic as a real-time leaderboard in Webflow alone would be cumbersome, so we‚Äôll stick with Framer + code or a custom code project.
Now that we have the stack outlined, let's break down the implementation of each feature and how to accomplish it, referencing relevant resources and examples.
Implementing the Interactive 3D Uranus Planet
The centerpiece is a large, clickable 3D Uranus. We want it to look like a planet floating in space that the user can ‚Äútouch‚Äù. Here are two main approaches:
Using Three.js (custom code): We can programmatically create a 3D scene with a camera, lights, and a sphere mesh for Uranus. The sphere can be given a material with a color or texture. (Uranus in reality is a pale blue cyan; we might go with a stylized solid color or use a NASA texture if available.) We will position the camera facing the sphere head-on. The sphere can slowly rotate for a dynamic feel. For clicking:
Use raycasting to detect if the sphere was clicked (so clicks on empty space are ignored). In Three.js, you attach a mouse click listener and use raycaster.intersectObject(planetMesh) to see if the planet was hit.
On each click, trigger a small animation on the planet: e.g. scale it up slightly then back down (a ‚Äúsquash and stretch‚Äù to give a bouncy feel). This can be done by tweaking the mesh scale in a quick tween. Alternatively, swap the texture or material briefly (Popcat famously alternated the image to an open-mouth cat; for Uranus, maybe we briefly overlay a graphic or change color for a ‚Äòtouched‚Äô effect).
Three.js starfield: We can also use Three.js to create a starfield background in the same canvas. For instance, many tutorials show spawning hundreds of small white points in the scene to simulate stars
creativejs.com
. We could create a large sphere surrounding the camera with a starry texture, or simply add points scattered in 3D space. However, a simpler non-Three.js star background might suffice (see next section).
Once Three.js is set up, integrate it into our page. If using Framer, we can include an HTML embed and initialize the Three.js script there. We need to ensure the canvas is full-width/height behind our UI or specifically sized to the planet container.
Resource: If needed, the official Three.js docs and examples can guide material and interactions. Also, to manage quick animations on click, GSAP (GreenSock) could be used with Three.js objects for easy tweens, though it‚Äôs an extra library that might not be needed for a simple scale effect.
Using Spline (visual 3D embed): Design the planet in Spline‚Äôs GUI:
Create a sphere, color it (or texture it). Possibly add a ring if we want (Uranus has rings, but faint; a cartoon ring might exaggerate the planet look).
Add minimal interactivity in Spline: for example, you can enable orbit controls or on-click animations in Spline‚Äôs editor (Spline recently added simple on-click events support, like playing an animation).
Once satisfied, get the shareable URL from Spline. In Framer, use an Embed component and paste that URL. The Framer blog confirms it‚Äôs ‚Äújust two steps: export link from Spline, then paste into Framer embed‚Äù
framer.com
.
The planet will appear as an interactive object. You could potentially have it respond to pointer hover/tap with some wiggle if configured. If Spline doesn‚Äôt natively send an event to our code on click, we could overlay an invisible <div> that covers the canvas and handle clicks that way (since we really just need the count, not any 3D-specific info from the click).
The advantage of Spline is speed and visuals without coding. The drawback is less fine-grained control for our custom logic. But since we mainly need to detect a click anywhere on the planet area, an overlay approach works.
Alternative: If full 3D is too heavy, consider a pseudo-3D or high-quality 2D image:
We could use a PNG of Uranus (maybe a rendered image) and make it bouncy on click with CSS/JS. This is the simplest fallback if Three.js embedding becomes problematic. The downside is losing the cool factor of 3D rotation. Given the preference for Three.js, we‚Äôll aim for actual 3D unless time gets too tight.
Regardless of method, after each click on the planet we will: (a) increment the local and global counters, (b) play a sound, and (c) possibly trigger any milestone easter egg (more on those soon). In terms of performance, a single sphere and some stars in Three.js is very lightweight, so it should work even on mobile. Spline‚Äôs embed might be a bit heavier (depends on complexity of the scene). We‚Äôll keep an eye on frame rate; if it stutters on mobile, we might simplify materials or effects (e.g., no shadows or overly complex lighting).
Implementing the Global Country-Based Leaderboard
The leaderboard is critical for the viral aspect. It will show countries ranked by total touches. Here‚Äôs how to implement it:
Detect User‚Äôs Country: On page load (or first interaction), call the geolocation API. For example, fetch('https://country.is/') which returns {"country":"US"} (as an example)
country.is
. We parse that to get the country code (e.g. ‚ÄúUS‚Äù). We might also want the country name for display and a flag emoji or image. We can maintain a map of country code to country name, or use a second API call if needed (but we can hardcode a small mapping or use an npm package if we had more time). The flag could be done by using the country code with regional indicator symbols (for ‚ÄúUS‚Äù, the Unicode flag üá∫üá∏ is composed of letters U and S). Simpler: use a CDN that serves flag icons by country code.
Initialize Database connection: Connect to Firebase (or chosen backend) using its client SDK. This involves including the Firebase script, calling firebase.initializeApp({...config...}) with our project config, then getting a reference to the database (Realtime DB or Firestore). Due to time, a NoSQL structure is quickest:
For Realtime DB: a JSON structure like /touches/{countryCode} = count. We would use firebase.database().ref("touches/US") and do a transaction or .set() with increment. (Firestore could similarly have a collection countries with documents named by country code and a field count.)
One convenient approach: use Firestore‚Äôs increment field value feature in an update call (so it‚Äôs atomic). Or use Realtime DB‚Äôs transaction function on that node.
Since we expect high frequency writes, Realtime DB might handle it slightly better. But either is fine for a prototype.
Update on Click: When user clicks:
Local: increment a JavaScript variable myTouches and update the on-screen personal counter.
Global: call the DB update. For example, in pseudo-code:
js
Copy
Edit
const country = myCountryCode;
db.ref("touches/"+country).transaction(current => (current || 0) + 1);
This will atomically increment the count in the database.
For efficiency, we might not want to do a network write on every single click if the click rate is extremely high (e.g., someone auto-clicking 100 times in a second). We could batch them (accumulate locally and send in intervals). However, Popcat did accept very high loads by throttling the rate. Perhaps limit to e.g. 10 per second that actually get sent to DB (store extra in a local buffer if user goes beyond, and send later). But in 6 hours, implementing a simple throttle (like allow one increment per 100ms) is enough.
Realtime Leaderboard Display: Set up a listener to retrieve and display leaderboard data:
We can use a Firebase query to get top N countries sorted by count. In Realtime DB, data is usually unordered unless we structure it differently (like store as an array of records). One trick: store negative counts as keys to sort, but that‚Äôs overkill here. Instead, it might be simplest to retrieve the whole touches object periodically and sort it in JS. However, Firestore allows ordering by a field and limit ‚Äì so Firestore might make getting the top 10 easier with a query.
Considering simplicity, we could just use Realtime DB‚Äôs .on("value") on touches/ and get the object of all countries whenever it changes. Then sort the entries by value and take the top ones for display. This is fine if number of countries is manageable (at most ~200 countries). The update frequency might be high, but limiting to maybe one update per second in UI is okay.
Display each country as a row: e.g. flag, country name, and count. We can create a small table or list in HTML. For a memey touch, the heading might say ‚ÄúWhich country is touching Uranus the most?‚Äù üòÑ
Personal contribution: We could highlight the user‚Äôs own country in the list (e.g., bold it or show ‚ÄúYou‚Äù next to it) to personalize the experience.
Location granularity: The spec suggests just country, but the Sun article about Popcat clones mentioned some games listing city/region too
thesun.my
. If we wanted, we could get city from the IP API and perhaps show ‚ÄúUSA (New York)‚Äù for the user or a separate smaller ranking by city. But that‚Äôs extra; we‚Äôll stick to country for now.
Example & Inspiration: The Popcat clones like ‚ÄúPopdog‚Äù and ‚ÄúPopass‚Äù had similar leaderboards. In one clone (Popdin), after 1000 clicks the image changed and it ‚Äúlists down the locations of where you are popping from, besides your country name‚Äù
thesun.my
. We could consider showing on the UI something like ‚ÄúYou: [City, Country]‚Äù just for fun. However, focus first on the core country ranking.
Backend Setup: We should allocate maybe ~30 minutes early on to set up the Firebase project and rules:
If using Firestore: define a countries collection, maybe pre-create docs for each country to avoid any issues, or let them be created on the fly by the first click from that country.
If using Realtime DB: define security rules (or in a quick demo, set it public for simplicity, though not secure).
Possibly use Firebase Hosting to deploy the site (if not using Framer‚Äôs hosting). But since main domain is enteruranus.com, we might point DNS to wherever we host (Framer can host on a custom domain, or we use Vercel/Netlify for a custom-coded site).
If not comfortable with Firebase, an alternative is using a simple serverless function and an in-memory or Redis DB ‚Äì but that‚Äôs overkill for 6 hours. Firebase is plug-and-play.
Testing: Once we have increment and display working, test it with a couple of different country codes (we can spoof our country by calling the increment function with a chosen code). Ensure the leaderboard updates in real time. This part is crucial to get right early, as it‚Äôs the main ‚Äúgameplay‚Äù hook.
Space-Themed UI Design (Stars, Planets, and Fun Elements)
To immerse users in a goofy space adventure, we need a space backdrop and thematic UI elements:
Animated Starfield Background: A moving starfield gives a sense of depth and motion behind the main action.
Canvas approach: Create a <canvas> that covers the background and use JavaScript to draw stars (small circles or dots) at random positions. Each frame, move them slightly (e.g. downward or toward the viewer) to simulate drifting through space. When a star goes off screen, wrap it around. This can create a subtle parallax effect of flying through starfield. Many existing snippets exist for ‚ÄúCSS starfield‚Äù or ‚ÄúJS starfield animation‚Äù we can adapt.
CSS approach: Use a dark background color (black or dark blue) and sprinkle blurred white dots via CSS (for example, a repeating radial-gradient). Or use an SVG/data URI background with stars. Static stars are okay, but subtle animation is nicer.
Three.js alternative: As noted, we could actually include stars in the Three.js scene as particles, which might be easiest if we already have Three.js initialized. For example, create a geometry of many small points with PointsMaterial. This way, the 3D camera moving (or a shader) could even make them twinkle. But given time, a simple 2D approach might suffice and be less performance-heavy.
Graphic background: Another quick option is using a pre-made space image (like a galaxy image or NASA starfield) as a background image (with CSS background-image). But those can be large and not as fun as an animated field. If we find a suitable small star tile, that could work in a pinch.
Planet/UFO/Space Decor: To amplify the cartoon theme, add some floating images or animations:
We might have a cute cartoon astronaut floating on the side, or a small alien peeking out. These could be static PNG/SVG elements with a gentle float animation (CSS keyframes to move up and down slowly, or rotate slightly).
A rocket ship could periodically fly across the screen. Perhaps on a loop or triggered by an event. We can implement a rocket animation using CSS (position: absolute; animation: move-across 10s linear infinite;) or use a Lottie rocket animation for smoother effects (there are free Lotties of rockets launching).
A satellite or UFO could spin in a corner.
The text/counters themselves can be styled in a fun way, maybe with a sci-fi font or with an outline glow (neon blue or green glows to match space).
Easter egg elements (like the Uranus logo graphic that appears after 69 clicks) should be prepared (more on that next section), but we can create a placeholder in the UI that‚Äôs hidden until triggered.
Color scheme & typography: Likely a dark background (#000 or #111) with bright accents (neon cyan, purple, pink ‚Äì classic ‚Äúspace neon‚Äù palette). Text could be white or light gray for readability. Important headings could use a funky display font (if brand has one, or something like a retro sci-fi font from Google Fonts).
We have to ensure contrast (avoid pure black on pure white for eyes; maybe use a starfield image with slight blue tint, etc.).
Buttons (like share buttons or the copy address button) can use the Uranus theme color (if the coin has a brand color).
Layout: The main viewport likely has:
Center: Uranus planet (big clickable area).
Top or bottom: a counter display ‚Äì perhaps show ‚ÄúYour touches: X‚Äù and maybe ‚Äú[Country]‚Äôs touches: Y‚Äù. Or we can integrate the personal count into the button itself (like the planet could have a number overlay of your count). But separate HUD-style text might be clearer.
Side or below: the leaderboard list of countries. Possibly a vertical list on the side on desktop, and maybe a collapsible or scrollable section on mobile (to not crowd the screen).
After some scrolling or a ‚ÄúLearn more‚Äù prompt, the information section (exchanges, social links, etc.) will follow. We might have a down-arrow indicator to encourage scrolling after playing with the planet.
Possibly the PFP generator is a separate page or a modal launched by a button in the info section (‚ÄúCreate Uranus Profile Pic!‚Äù).
Responsive considerations: On mobile, probably the planet and counter take up most of the screen initially, and the leaderboard might be a smaller section or a button like ‚ÄúView leaderboard‚Äù that expands, since vertical screen space is limited. We want to prioritize the big button and fun experience on small screens, with the competition aspect maybe one tap away if needed.
We can refine the design quickly in Framer (dragging in assets, adding text, etc.) and use Framer‚Äôs preview to ensure it feels right before hooking up all the logic.
Funny Easter Eggs and Milestone Surprises
One of the goals is to reward users with humor when they hit certain milestones in their clicking:
69 Touches ‚Äì ‚ÄúNice‚Äù moment: The number 69 is a meme in itself. Upon the user‚Äôs 69th click, we can trigger a special event. For example:
Show the Uranus coin logo prominently with a funny effect. The brief suggests ‚Äúthe Uranus logo appears (anus) or something equally silly happens.‚Äù Perhaps the letters ‚ÄúURANUS‚Äù appear and the ‚ÄúUR‚Äù fades out, cheekily highlighting ‚ÄúANUS‚Äù for a moment (if going for that level of juvenile humor üòÇ). Or a graphic of a literal butt (since the name lends itself to that joke) could flash with a ‚Äúnice!‚Äù text. It depends on how far we want to take the joke; since this is a meme coin project, leaning into the immature humor is likely fine.
We could play a special sound at that moment, e.g. a voice saying ‚Äúnice‚Äù or a celebratory noise (crowd cheer, etc.) along with the visual.
Implementation: our click handler can check if (myTouches === 69) then execute a function to show the easter egg. That might involve unhiding a DOM element or playing a Lottie animation. For example, we could have a hidden Lottie (or GIF) of the project‚Äôs logo doing something silly, and then remove it after a few seconds.
Other Funny Numbers: If time permits, consider also 420 (the cannabis meme number) or 100 (a nice round number) for easter eggs:
At 420 clicks, maybe show a little smoke or 8-bit ‚Äú420‚Äù popup ‚Äì depends on the brand‚Äôs tolerance for that joke.
At 100 or 500 clicks, do something like a ‚ÄúEntering Uranus Mode‚Äù (the optional idea described): perhaps an animation where the camera zooms into the planet as if entering it.
This could be achieved in Three.js by moving the camera through the sphere, then swapping to a different scene (inside view). Inside Uranus, we could show a silly hidden message or graphic (like ‚Äúüêê You found the goat!‚Äù or some totally random meme, the more absurd the better).
If implementing Enter Uranus mode: We would schedule it at a certain click count (maybe exactly 100, or maybe if a user keeps clicking beyond a threshold at once). The screen could do a transition (e.g. flash or a ‚Äúwarp speed‚Äù starfield) and then show the inside for a moment. After a few seconds, it returns back out to normal. This is a complex but fun easter egg, so only tackle it if core features are done.
Alternatively, an easier interpretation: after X clicks, instead of a full new 3D scene, we could simply overlay a fun graphic or full-screen GIF as if you've gone through a portal. For instance, a meme image could slide up saying ‚ÄúWelcome to Uranus!‚Äù and then slide away.
Random Surprises: Easter eggs could also trigger based on global events or random chance:
Perhaps a small chance on any click to spawn a UFO flying by or a random voice line like ‚ÄúWatch it!‚Äù from an alien.
We can pre-create a list of such events and when a click happens, if Math.random() < 0.001 then spawn UFO.
This keeps the experience unpredictable and entertaining for heavy clickers.
Implementing Animations for Easter Eggs: We should prepare a couple of assets in advance for these:
UFO fly-by: Could be a Lottie animation or a CSS animation of an SVG image. For example, a Lottie of a UFO could include it entering from one side and exiting the other. We‚Äôd simply play it when triggered.
Rocket launch: Similarly, a rocket blasting off maybe from the bottom of the screen upward.
Logo reveal: If the Uranus logo is a vector (SVG), we could animate it with CSS (e.g., slide in, spin, then out). Or use a pre-made animation via Lottie (we can create a quick After Effects animation of the text/logo appearing).
The Ricardo Milos meme in Popass had a ‚Äúsatisfying slapping sound‚Äù as the user clicked his posterior
thesun.my
. Our equivalent sound gag could be a ‚Äúfart noise‚Äù at a certain count, given the juvenile theme of ‚ÄúUranus‚Äù. This might be optional depending on taste, but it would surprise users. If we wanted to do it at 69 or 420 clicks, it‚Äôs definitely on-brand for a Uranus joke. Just ensure any such sound is used sparingly to remain funny and not obnoxious.
Inspiration from Popcat clones: The article on Popcat clones gives us confidence in adding these extras. One clone changed the image after 1000 clicks to something more intense to motivate users further
thesun.my
 ‚Äì which is analogous to our ‚ÄúEnter Uranus mode‚Äù idea. We‚Äôll aim to include at least one big change if the user is very engaged (like the inside view or a new graphic) to keep them hooked.
Development plan for easter eggs: We should list out which milestones to implement (likely 69 and 1000 are good picks, possibly 100 or 420 if time). Implementing one or two thoroughly is better than half-doing many. Focus on 69 first (since it‚Äôs early and many will hit it, it‚Äôs a guaranteed laugh). Then if time, implement the bigger one at 100 or beyond.
Click Counters and Sound Effects
The site needs to provide immediate feedback for each touch to feel satisfying:
Click Counters: We will display two main counters:
Personal Clicks ‚Äì how many times you have touched Uranus. This can simply be a number on screen labeled ‚ÄúYour touches‚Äù or even just overlaid on the planet (like a small badge that follows the planet). This count resets if the user refreshes (unless we store it in localStorage to persist during a session).
Country Total ‚Äì the total clicks from your country. This gives the user a sense of contributing to a larger team effort. For example, it might say ‚ÄúUSA: 123,456 touches‚Äù updated live.
We will update the personal count immediately on click (increment a JS variable and update DOM text).
The country total will update in real-time via our database listener as described. There might be a slight delay (milliseconds) from the roundtrip, but it should feel near-instant on Firebase. We could optimistically also increment the country count locally on click and later correct it if the server value updates differently.
Optionally, a global total counter (all countries combined) can be shown for bragging rights (like ‚ÄúTotal touches worldwide: X‚Äù). This is just the sum of all countries. We can maintain it client-side by summing the leaderboard data, or have the backend store a running total too. It‚Äôs a nice-to-have visual, though the country competition is the focus.
Sound Effects on Touch: Every click will produce a sound, making the interaction more satisfying or funny.
We should have a short ‚Äúpop‚Äù or ‚Äúboop‚Äù sound (few milliseconds). We can either use one and play it each time, or have a set of a few variants to avoid it becoming monotonous. For example, load pop1.mp3, pop2.mp3, etc. and cycle through them on each click. This technique makes repeated clicks less grating because the ear gets slightly different sounds each time.
The prompt even suggests a meme-y voice saying ‚ÄúUranus!‚Äù. This could be really funny occasionally, but perhaps not on every click (that would slow things down and might become annoying). We can do something like: on every 10th click, play the voice clip instead of the normal pop. Or randomly with a low chance.
To get such a clip, we might record ourselves or use a text-to-speech with a humorous voice (some TTS have voices that could sound comical saying that word). Ensure the clip is short and clear.
Managing Audio: Use the Web Audio API or HTMLAudioElement. E.g., create an <audio> element for each sound. For rapid firing, it might be better to use the Web Audio API to play overlapping sounds without delay, but given moderate clicking speeds it‚Äôs probably fine to just .play() an <audio> and if needed, reset it. Modern browsers allow multiple quick plays as long as each is triggered by user interaction (which they are).
We need to watch out for rate limiting: If someone uses an autoclicker, hundreds of sounds could play ‚Äì that‚Äôs undesirable for performance and user experience. We might implement a simple cap: do not play more than e.g. 5 sounds per second; if the user goes beyond that, temporarily mute until their rate is lower. The clicking will still count, but sound won‚Äôt spam. This keeps things fair and also subtly discourages botting by removing some of the ‚Äúfun feedback‚Äù when going too fast.
Include a Mute button on the UI (like a small speaker icon). Many users appreciate being able to turn off sound without muting their whole device. Toggling mute can simply set a flag in our code that stops any new sound from playing. We can visually indicate mute state by icon change.
Haptic feedback (bonus): On mobile, we could use the Vibration API to give a slight vibration on touches, enhancing tactile feedback. A quick 10-20ms vibration on each tap could simulate a ‚Äútap feel‚Äù. This is a minor detail but if time allows, one line of JS (navigator.vibrate(20)) on click can add to the experience for mobile users.
By combining visual, auditory (and possibly haptic) feedback, each click will be satisfying. This immediate reward is key in clicker games ‚Äì it encourages the user to keep clicking, which in turn drives up the leaderboard and social sharing.
Social Sharing Integration
To help the site go viral, we‚Äôll implement easy social sharing prompts. The idea is after a user interacts (for example, after their first touch, or once they reach a funny milestone), we show a prompt like: ‚ÄúI just touched Uranus! Share this:‚Äù with buttons. The plan:
Twitter/X Share: This is the most straightforward. As mentioned, we use the intent/tweet URL with a pre-filled message. We should craft the message to include the campaign link and hashtags:
Example message: ‚ÄúI just touched Uranus üöÄ Check it out: enteruranus.com #Uranus $URANUS‚Äù. This includes a rocket emoji (fits theme), the site URL, a hashtag (#Uranus ‚Äì though that might mix with astronomy posts, but it‚Äôs short and on-brand) and $URANUS which is likely the token symbol used on Twitter to tag crypto coins.
We should URL-encode this text and append to https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=.... Clicking that opens Twitter‚Äôs web/app with the tweet ready to send. No API keys or complex OAuth needed since it‚Äôs just a link.
The share button in UI will be the Twitter logo or a stylized button. On desktop it opens a new window; on mobile it can either open the Twitter app if installed or web.
TikTok & Others: TikTok doesn‚Äôt allow pre-filled text sharing. But TikTok is more about posting videos. What we can do:
Encourage a challenge: e.g., user could screen-record their clicking and post on TikTok with the hashtag. This is more on the user side, not something our site can automate. We can at least put a TikTok icon that when clicked, perhaps opens TikTok (not sure if there‚Äôs a deep link we can use) or just copies the text to clipboard saying ‚ÄúCopied share text! Paste it in your TikTok or anywhere.‚Äù
Reddit: We could use a reddit submit link: https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=enteruranus.com&title=I%20just%20touched%20Uranus%21. That pre-fills a Reddit submission with our link and title, leaving the user to pick a subreddit and post. This might be less used, but crypto meme communities on Reddit might appreciate it.
Telegram: A link like https://t.me/share/url?url=enteruranus.com&text=I%20just%20touched%20Uranus... could allow sharing in Telegram (it opens the app to choose a chat to send to).
Given time, focus on Twitter since that‚Äôs the main place such memes spread in crypto. The others can be optional links or simply encourage manual sharing.
Placement of Share UI: Perhaps a fixed sidebar or a pop-up:
One idea: after a certain number of clicks (say 10 or 20), an overlay appears with the share message and buttons, as a gentle nudge. The user can close it if they want to continue clicking. Or a small persistent sidebar on the right with vertical buttons (like many sites have) saying ‚ÄúShare:‚Äù with icons.
We should ensure it‚Äôs not too intrusive to the clicking experience. Possibly a small slide-out panel that the user can open for sharing.
The share text should feel organic; we can allow the user‚Äôs current count in it e.g. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve touched Uranus 150 times already!‚Äù but that might be overkill. The simpler message is fine.
Tracking virality: Not a requirement, but if we had more time, integrating analytics to see how many shares or incoming referrals might be interesting. For now, focus on making sharing easy.
Mobile-Friendly Considerations
We touched on this under tech stack, but to summarize key points ensuring the site works on mobile (since a lot of casual users will be on phones):
Responsive Layout: Use Framer or CSS media queries to reorganize elements on small screens:
The leaderboard might collapse into a toggle or go below the planet instead of beside it.
Text sizes should adjust (use relative units like vw or clamp() for responsive font sizes).
Ensure buttons are not too small to tap. For instance, the share icons should be spaced out enough for a thumb press.
Hide any purely decorative elements on very small screens if they clutter (e.g., maybe hide a background astronaut graphic on a 320px wide display to keep focus).
Touch & Gesture Support: All interactions should be tap-friendly:
The Uranus planet click should work with touch events. (If using Three.js, we need to listen for ontouchstart as well to detect on mobile. In many cases, a click event will fire from a tap, but sometimes capturing touchstart can feel more responsive.)
If we allow dragging or some interaction with the planet (maybe rotating it manually), that needs to be intuitive with touch. But likely we keep it simple: just tapping.
Scrolling: The page might have sections to scroll; ensure that the main interactive canvas doesn‚Äôt prevent scrolling. Sometimes a full-screen canvas can trap touch events. We might give the canvas a fixed size (like top half of screen) and allow scrolling normally for the bottom half.
Performance: Mobile devices are less powerful; keep an eye on:
Not spawning too many stars or too heavy animations that could drop frame rates.
The Three.js scene should be very basic (one planet, maybe 100 particles for stars) ‚Äì this is fine. Avoid shadow calculations or anything expensive in Three.js.
Lottie animations are vector and usually performant, but too many running at once could slow things. We will only play them occasionally.
Test on a mid-range phone if possible. If it‚Äôs slow, consider using simpler images on mobile or provide an option to disable background animations.
Testing audio: On iOS Safari, audio can sometimes not play until a user has interacted once. We likely will have the first interaction immediately (the first tap on the planet) which should allow audio playback. We should test that the sound does indeed play on first tap ‚Äì if not, we might need a workaround (like having a hidden audio element ready to play on a dummy user gesture).
Fullscreen/Webapp mode: As an enhancement, we could add a meta tag to allow ‚ÄúAdd to Home Screen‚Äù and make the site run fullscreen like an app (progressive web app style). But in 6 hours, focusing on core is more important.
In short, by using Framer‚Äôs responsive design features and testing on mobile early, we can ensure the experience is equally fun on phones and desktops.
Information & Community Section (‚ÄúAbout Uranus‚Äù)
Once users have had their fun clicking, the site should seamlessly transition to an informational section about the Uranus coin project. This likely appears as one scrolls down (or maybe on a separate page, but better to include it on the main page after the interactive portion, so everyone sees it). Key elements to include:
Project Description: A brief blurb ‚ÄúWhat is Uranus coin?‚Äù ‚Äì possibly done in a humorous tone consistent with the site. But since it‚Äôs an actual coin, we should also convey legitimacy (if any üòú). This could be a couple of paragraphs or bullet points about the token, the community, etc.
Exchanges (CEX) Listings: A section titled ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre available on:‚Äù followed by exchange logos or names where $URANUS is listed. For example, if listed on Binance, Coinbase, etc (just hypothetical). If not major exchanges, maybe smaller ones or DEXes. We need to get those details from the project. The brief explicitly says CEX listings ‚Äì so list them. Often projects show exchange icons in grayscale logos. We can do an icon grid or a horizontal scroll of exchange badges.
Contract Address: Provide the token‚Äôs smart contract address (likely on Ethereum or BSC). Label it clearly, e.g., ‚ÄúOfficial Contract Address (ERC-20): [0xABC...123]‚Äù. And include a small copy button next to it:
This can be an icon (like üìã or a copy SVG). On click, use navigator.clipboard.writeText(address) to copy it. Change icon or show a tooltip ‚ÄúCopied!‚Äù as feedback.
This is important for users who want to add the token to their wallet or find it on blockchain scanners.
Community Links (Join the Uranus Community): Provide links to the project‚Äôs communities:
Twitter: likely the official project Twitter. Use the bird icon and link to their profile.
Twitter Community: The brief mentions ‚Äútwitter community‚Äù ‚Äì Twitter Communities is a feature where users can join a specific interest group. If Uranus coin has a community there, provide that link.
Telegram: Possibly multiple Telegram links were hinted (‚Äúmeme channel tg‚Äù). Maybe they have an official announcements channel and a meme chat. At least one Telegram link should be given (Telegram icon, link to join group).
Discord: Not mentioned, but many crypto projects have Discord. If exists, include it.
Dexscreener: This is a link to a chart. Likely the Dexscreener page for URANUS token where users can see price charts. We‚Äôll use their logo or just a chart icon and link it.
Website: If enteruranus.com is the main site, and uranuscoin.org is secondary domain, perhaps uranuscoin.org could host more detailed info or a whitepaper. If that‚Äôs the case, link it or make it the same site. The prompt suggests one can redirect to the other. We might not need separate content on uranuscoin.org, could just point it to the same site or use it for docs.
Visuals and Style: Keep the space/cartoon theme in this section too, but perhaps a bit toned down for readability:
Use icons for each social (Twitter bird, Telegram plane, etc., possibly in the same style or color scheme).
Possibly an illustration or mascot could accompany the about text ‚Äì e.g., a cartoon of the Uranus planet with a face, or an astronaut planting a flag that says ‚ÄúURANUS‚Äù on the planet. If we have time to quickly make such an illustration (AI or existing asset), it can add charm.
The section should feel cohesive with the top of the page but can have a slightly different background (for example, a dark blue instead of black, or a subtle gradient) to distinguish it as content section versus interactive section.
Layout: Could be a two-column layout: text on left, a graphic on right; followed by a row of exchange icons; then a row of social icons. Or stack them vertically on mobile.
We can use Framer to quickly create this as well, since static content layout is its strength.
Call to Action: If applicable, include a call to action like ‚ÄúBuy Uranus on [Exchange]‚Äù with a link, or ‚ÄúJoin our Telegram for updates‚Äù. The goal is to convert the visitor‚Äôs enjoyment of the game into interest in the coin itself.
This information section ensures the site not only entertains but also educates and onboards people into the Uranus coin ecosystem.
Profile Picture (PFP) Generator Feature
As an extra engagement tool, a profile picture generator lets users create a custom avatar with the Uranus theme ‚Äì perfect for showing support on social media. The idea is similar to the example WIF PFP generator, which presumably lets users add a memecoin‚Äôs logo to their own image. How to implement this quickly:
User Interface: A simple interface where a user can upload a photo (or drag-and-drop). We then overlay the Uranus logo (or a frame) on it, and allow the user to download the new image.
There could be a dedicated page or section for this, accessed via a ‚ÄúCreate Your Uranus PFP‚Äù button in the info section.
The UI elements: an <input type="file" accept="image/*"> for upload (and possibly a preview area).
A canvas or preview <div> where we show the result.
A ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù button to save the final image.
Overlay Image: We need a transparent PNG or SVG of the Uranus logo or some frame. Often meme coins make a circular frame with their logo that goes around a Twitter profile picture. If they provided assets, use those. If not, we can create one: e.g., a round border with stars and the text ‚ÄúUranus‚Äù at the bottom. But likely they have a logo PNG we can use directly, placing it in a corner of the photo or as a small badge.
For an example, Dogecoin community often had a small Shiba Inu head you could overlay on your pic. We‚Äôll do similarly with the Uranus planet or logo.
Image Processing: Use an HTML5 Canvas to composite the images:
User uploads an image ‚Äì we get a File object, turn it into an Image object (use FileReader or set the src of an Image to the object URL).
Draw the user‚Äôs image onto a canvas (probably scale it to a standard size, like 500x500 for a profile pic).
Draw the overlay PNG on top at the desired position (e.g., bottom-right corner, or full overlay).
Provide a download link. We can use canvas.toBlob() and create a download URL, or simply canvas.toDataURL("image/png") and set an <a download> href to that.
Optionally, allow some adjustments:
Maybe allow the user to zoom/position their photo under the frame. But that complicates UI (requires adding controls). Given the time, we might assume they upload a already-cropped square face photo. Perhaps just mention recommended size/shape.
If using a circular frame, we might want to crop their image to a circle. We can do that on canvas by drawing a circle clip path, then the image.
Testing: We need to test with a sample image to ensure the overlay appears correctly and the download works on both desktop and mobile (mobile Safari might not allow direct download; we might instead display the result and tell them long-press to save, etc.).
Hosting/Integration: If using a separate page, we can route to it (maybe enteruranus.com/pfp). If using Framer, we might be able to incorporate custom code for the canvas inside a code component. Alternatively, we could quickly spin up a standalone HTML page for it and just link to it. But for unity, integrating into the main site is nicer.
Reference: There are GitHub projects and codepens for profile photo generators. For example, a GitHub project called watermelon-profile did a similar overlay concept
github.com
. We can use a similar approach: they likely used canvas and an upload input. Our scenario is simpler (one fixed overlay).
The PFP generator is a nifty viral tool: users who make a Uranus-themed profile pic will effectively advertise the project on social platforms. It‚Äôs worth including if time permits after core features.
Asset Preparation and Format Conversion
You mentioned having assets in PNG format and the desire to use them in interactive ways (possibly converting to SVG or Lottie). This is a common challenge: raster images don‚Äôt animate or scale well, so converting to vector or obtaining vector versions is ideal for animations. Here‚Äôs how to approach asset prep:
Identify Key Assets: likely assets include:
Uranus coin logo (perhaps a stylized text or icon).
The planet Uranus image (if not using 3D).
Rocket, UFO, astronaut illustrations (if provided).
Any background elements (stars, etc).
Any meme graphics for easter eggs.
Use as PNG vs Convert to SVG: If an asset is only used as a static image or with simple CSS transforms, using the PNG directly is fine. But if we need to animate parts of it, or scale it up, converting to SVG is beneficial.
For example, if the Uranus logo will appear large on screen as part of an animation, having it vector means it stays sharp. If we only have PNG, we should see if it‚Äôs high resolution enough. If not, vectorize it:
Tools like Adobe Illustrator (Image Trace) or Inkscape can often trace a logo if it‚Äôs not too complex. There are also online auto-trace tools (Vectorizer.ai, or the Recraft vectorizer we mentioned).
Recraft‚Äôs blog notes that going from PNG to Lottie requires vectorization first: ‚Äúconverting raster PNG to vector-based Lottie is trickier... try converting PNG to SVG with an auto vectorization tool, then use SVG-to-Lottie‚Äù
lottiefiles.com
. This only works well for **‚Äúsimple, 2D illustrations‚Äù*
lottiefiles.com
. So, a flat logo or icon will likely vectorize okay; a detailed or shaded image (like a photo of a planet) will not vectorize cleanly.
For the planet Uranus: if we wanted a cartoon look, perhaps just draw a circle with a gradient or simple texture ‚Äì that can be done directly in canvas or as an SVG by hand. Vectorizing a NASA photo of Uranus wouldn‚Äôt yield a nice result, so better to either use a simpler cartoon graphic or go full 3D.
Rocket/UFO: If we have PNGs of these, they probably can be vectorized if they are cartoon-style. Alternatively, search LottieFiles library for ‚Äúrocket‚Äù ‚Äì likely someone has a free rocket animation we can reuse, which saves time and looks great. Using pre-made Lotties might be the most time-efficient way to get high-quality animations without making them from scratch. We just have to attribute if required (many are free without attribution).
Converting to Lottie: If we have an SVG and want to animate it ourselves quickly:
LottieFiles SVG to Lottie tool: upload SVG, choose an animation style (they have some presets like pulse, drop-in, etc.). This is a super-fast way to get a basic motion on an otherwise static asset.
After Effects: If someone on the team knows After Effects, creating a custom animation and exporting via Bodymovin plugin as Lottie is an option. In 6 hours though, doing this for multiple assets might be tight unless the animations are very simple.
Rive: For interactive ones, if someone is proficient in Rive, they could import the SVG and animate with keyframes or state machine and then export the .riv file (or use the runtime). This is great for e.g. making the UFO‚Äôs lights blink on hover, etc. But again, only if skill/time allows.
Using PNGs with CSS/JS: Don‚Äôt underestimate simple approaches: for example, a PNG of a UFO can be moved across the screen with CSS animation (translate from left to right). Even though it‚Äôs not vector, if its size is fine and we‚Äôre not rotating or scaling it massively, it will look okay. Also, CSS filters can be applied to PNGs (like blur, brightness changes for a hover effect).
So, if conversion proves too slow or low quality, just use the PNG and animate its position or opacity with code.
Optimize assets: Ensure any images used are optimized for web (compressed appropriately). Since this is a meme site, slight loss in quality is acceptable. Use tools like ImageOptim or tinypng if needed to reduce file sizes. The 3D canvas (if used) will handle the heavy visual of the planet, so other images should ideally be lightweight so the site loads fast even on mobile data.
Asset Pipeline in Code: Prepare the assets folder with clearly named files so that in code we can easily swap them in/out. For instance, planet.png, logo.svg, rocket.json (Lottie file), etc. This way, hooking them up in the implementation phase is quicker.
In summary, prioritize converting critical interactive visuals to vector/Lottie (like the logo for the 69-click animation, and any repetitive animation like the rocket). Less critical or static assets can remain PNG for now. Use the mentioned tools (Illustrator/Inkscape for SVG, LottieFiles/Recraft for quick Lottie conversions) to speed this up. Given the limited time, choose your battles on which assets truly need conversion and which can work as-is.
Development Timeline (Next 6 Hours)
To deliver this project quickly, we need to be efficient and possibly work in parallel on some tasks. Here‚Äôs a rough breakdown of how to tackle everything in ~6 hours:
Hour 0‚Äì1: Setup and Base Structure
Framer project: If using Framer‚Äôs site builder, quickly set up a new project with the intended sections (hero area for the game, and an about section). Alternatively, set up a simple HTML/CSS/JS project if coding from scratch (maybe using a template like Vite or Create React App if React). This initial setup should also include adding any libraries (Firebase SDK, Three.js, Lottie web player script, etc.).
Firebase config: Initialize the Firebase project in the code (you‚Äôll need the config keys). Set up dummy data structure if needed.
Basic HTML structure: Place a placeholder for the planet (e.g. a <div id="planet-container"> or canvas), a placeholder for leaderboard list, and text elements for counters. Style them roughly so we see positions.
Add geolocation call: Immediately get the country code (can test with your IP).
Result of Hour 1: The page loads with a basic layout, prints your country code in console (for testing), and maybe a static ‚ÄúPlanet‚Äù label where the button will be. No interactivity yet, but foundation is there.
Hour 1‚Äì2: Core Interaction & Graphics
Three.js Planet or Spline embed: Implement the Uranus planet. If Three.js, write the code to create the scene, sphere, etc., and mount the canvas in the planet-container. Test that it appears (maybe a static rotation). If Spline, create the Spline scene and embed it (this might actually be faster if the Spline model is quick to make ‚Äì e.g., just a sphere with a texture). Ensure you can capture a click (even a generic click anywhere for now).
Click handler: Implement the on-click event on the planet area ‚Äì for now just increment a number and log it. Also, play a test sound (just to integrate audio early).
Leaderboards data: Set up the Firebase path for the detected country and do a test increment in console to ensure database writes work. Also set up a basic onValue listener to log the top countries.
Result of Hour 2: You should be able to click the planet and see a number increment on screen (your personal count) and perhaps see the database updating your country‚Äôs count. Visuals might still be rough (planet might be plain, no starfield yet), but functionality is forming.
Hour 2‚Äì3: Leaderboard & Real-time Updates
Leaderboard UI: Code the function to sort countries and display a list of top ones. Style the list (maybe country flag and name, count). Connect the Firebase listener to update this list live. Test by manually updating some country counts in DB or by simulating from two different countries (you could temporarily fake the country code to add different entries).
Starfield background: Implement the background (maybe import a quick star CSS or canvas script). Ensure it sits behind everything (z-index or as a background layer in CSS).
Basic styling & layout fixes: At this point, refine the positioning: center the planet nicely, ensure leaderboard is not overlapping, etc. Make it look presentable.
Sound effect integration: Load the actual sound files (pop sound etc.) and replace the test sound. Confirm it plays on each click. Add the mute toggle button and test it.
Result of Hour 3: The core game loop is fully working ‚Äì you can click, hear pops, see your count, and see the leaderboard reacting. The site has a spacey background and things are aligned. At this halfway point, the essential functionality is done.
Hour 3‚Äì4: Polish Interactions & Easter Eggs
Planet feedback animation: Add that bounce or visual feedback on click. In Three.js, maybe scale the sphere up 1.1x for 0.1s then back. Or in CSS, apply a .clicked class that triggers a keyframe on the element (if using an <img> or if Spline, maybe skip this if not possible, and use an overlay effect instead). This makes clicking more tactile.
Implement the 69-click easter egg: Prepare the asset (e.g., the Uranus logo graphic). Animate it: for simplicity, could fade in and spin, then fade out. Use CSS animations or a small Lottie if we created one. Trigger this when count==69. Test it.
Plan ‚ÄúEnter Uranus mode‚Äù: If doing the zoom-in at 100 or 1000 clicks, outline how to implement: maybe moving camera in Three.js. If time allows, code it. If not, set it aside.
Other fun elements: Add the rocket or UFO element. For example, add a hidden rocket element and use @keyframes rocketFlight to move it across screen. Trigger it at 50 clicks or on a random interval. Also add any random sound easter egg (like a 1% chance for a special sound on click).
Test on mobile: By now, give it a quick run on a phone if possible. See if canvas and clicks work, if sound works on first tap. Adjust as needed (maybe add a user gesture requirement or a ‚ÄúTap to start‚Äù overlay that does nothing but allow audio context).
Result of Hour 4: The interactive part should now be fun ‚Äì with animations, surprises, and polished feedback. It should feel close to final in terms of user experience.
Hour 4‚Äì5: Social & Info Section
Social sharing prompt: Implement the share buttons. Possibly create a small component or div that appears after a few clicks. Write the Twitter intent link and test it (make sure the text formats correctly). For now, this can be a simple fixed element or a popup.
About/Info content: Write out the text for the about section (you might get this from project documentation or wing it with placeholders). Add exchange logos (find and import SVGs or PNGs of the exchanges). Layout this nicely in Framer or code (maybe use a 2-column grid).
Community links: Add icons and links for Twitter, Telegram, etc., in a ‚ÄúJoin Community‚Äù subsection. Ensure the links open in new tab.
Contract address: Put the address text and code the copy button. Test that copying works.
Styling: Make sure this section still carries the theme ‚Äì maybe add a subtle background (like a lighter space background or just a dark solid color to differentiate). Ensure text is readable (perhaps use a normal font for paragraphs, reserve funky font for titles).
Result of Hour 5: The page is content-complete. You have the interactive game at top and the informative section below. All links and features are present. The site could be ‚Äúdone‚Äù at this point, barring final tweaks.
Hour 5‚Äì6: PFP Generator & Final Testing
PFP Generator page: If aiming to include this, build a simple page or modal. Since by now the main page is done, you can afford to use remaining time to implement this feature.
Create the HTML: an upload input and canvas, plus a default overlay image loaded.
Write the JS: when an image is selected, draw it to canvas with the overlay. Then show a download button. If using Framer, possibly use a Code component that handles this.
Test the output by uploading a couple of different images. Check the downloaded file.
If short on time, you might link to the wifpfp app as a placeholder (‚ÄúComing soon‚Äù or something). But ideally, get a basic version working.
Final Testing: Go through everything ‚Äì does the leaderboard update correctly with multiple users (maybe open two windows)? Does the sound behave? Is the layout okay on different screen sizes (use dev tools to simulate)? Try weird inputs (e.g., click 69 times very fast, does it trigger the easter egg properly only once? etc.).
Bug fixes: Fix any discovered issues quickly. Common quick fixes might be adjusting z-index (e.g., the easter egg graphic should appear above all other elements), or adjusting Firebase security if something‚Äôs not writing, etc.
Deployment: If using Framer‚Äôs hosting, publish the site to the provided domain and map enteruranus.com to it (this might involve DNS which could be done after code is ready). If using a custom code solution, deploy to Vercel or Netlify which can connect to the custom domain quickly. Ensure environment variables or config (Firebase keys) are correctly set in production mode.
Result of Hour 6: The full site is live or ready to go live, with all primary and secondary features implemented. üéâ
Throughout this 6-hour sprint, keep an eye on the priority: it‚Äôs better to have a working, polished core site (click game + basic info) than an incomplete one with too many half-finished features. So if time runs low, drop the stretch features (like PFP generator or the complex ‚Äúenter Uranus‚Äù 3D scene) and focus on making what‚Äôs done truly solid and bug-free.
Conclusion
By leveraging high-level tools like Framer for layout, Three.js (or Spline) for 3D, Firebase for quick backend, and assets/animations from Lottie or Rive, we can rapidly build the ‚ÄúTouch Uranus First‚Äù site. The plan above ensures all requirements are met: a competitive country leaderboard, a fun interactive Uranus button with instant feedback, humorous surprises at key moments, social sharing to drive virality, and a follow-up info section to convert engagement into community growth. The use of AI tools can further accelerate asset creation (e.g., quickly vectorizing and animating our PNG assets so they become interactive content
